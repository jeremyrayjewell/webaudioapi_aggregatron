# Guidance:
# - In Netlify UI for this site: set Base directory = synth_aggregatrex5000 (exact spelling).
# - Publish directory = build (Netlify will look inside the base after running command).
# - Remove any previous wrong base (like synth_aggregatrex500).
# - This redirect block is optional if you only serve the root path.[build]
# No 'base' here because this file sits at the project root (the subfolder you want to build).

# Notes:
# 1. In the Netlify UI make sure the Base directory is either blank (if this site is created directly from this subfolder repo path)
#    OR explicitly set to 'synth_aggregatrex5000' (spelled exactly) if the repo root is used.
# 2. The previous failure was caused by a typo: 'synth_aggregatrex500' (missing the last '0').
# 3. After correcting, trigger a new deploy; Netlify will run the command above and publish the './build' folder.
